#Northwind DB test
- Followed the instructions: I have MSSQL studio and this DB would throw tons of errors when running the script. I think this is because the DB requires server 2000.

#Assumptions
- we were told to keep it basic, so I kept everything in the same tier.
- not catering for users as it was not required.

# BettingGames
- code-first approach, migrations.
- Run the api.
- swagger will launch.
- Endpoint PlayRoulette is the endpoint you can use.
- Endpoint GetAllPreviousBets to return all bets you have currently entered.
- Endpoint TestExceptionHandler to test global exception handling.

#Not Done
- sql - Northwind DB would throw erros when following instructions on MSSQL Studio, couldnt get this to run and did not have the time.
- add unit tests.
